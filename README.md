## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a fully functional, console-based implementation of the classic 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The program must be capable of generating a solvable puzzle, managing player input, providing real-time validation of moves against Sudoku rules, and maintaining a score based on performance. This project serves as a real-world relevant application of data structures (2D arrays) and recursive algorithms (backtracking).
